# SPAM-HAM-DETECTION-PROJECT
A spam/ham detection project is used to identify and classify incoming emails as either "spam" (unsolicited, irrelevant or potentially harmful messages) or "ham" (legitimate, desired messages).
The Naive Bayes classifier is mainly used here.
- CountVectorizer is used for converting text data into numerical feature vectors.
- MultinomialNB: A Naive Bayes classifier suitable for text classification.

# Importance of this project
1. Email Filtering: The primary purpose of spam/ham detection is to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful email messages. This helps users focus on legitimate and relevant emails, saving time and improving productivity.
2. Reducing Clutter: Spam emails can clutter users' inboxes and overwhelm them with irrelevant content. By detecting and removing spam, the inbox becomes more organized and easier to manage.
3. Preventing Fraud and Phishing: Many spam emails attempt to deceive users by posing as legitimate entities (banks, companies, etc.) to steal sensitive information. Effective detection helps prevent users from falling victim to phishing attacks and fraud.
4. Resource Conservation: Filtering out spam reduces the resources required for email storage, processing, and network bandwidth. This is particularly important for email service providers and businesses that handle a large volume of emails.
5. User Experience: Providing users with a clean and safe email environment enhances their experience and satisfaction with email services.
6. Efficient Communication: By ensuring that important emails (ham) are not buried under spam messages, users can communicate more effectively and receive timely responses to their inquiries.
Economic Impact: Reducing spam can have economic benefits, as businesses spend less time dealing with unwanted messages and security threats.
